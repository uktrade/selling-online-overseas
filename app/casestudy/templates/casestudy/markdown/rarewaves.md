quote_two_content: The UK is one part of a global market. If you are a UK retailer only selling domestically, you are missing a massive trick. I would advise speaking to DIT to form an overseas e-commerce strategy, there is a world of opportunity out there and DIT is helping to fill in the gaps with British Businesses.

London-based company, Rarewaves, started when founder Brad Aspess noticed a gap in the market for selling music products online. With more than 100,000 vinyl records in his collection he setup a UK shop through eBay but within 12 months the company was exporting to Germany, France, the US and Australia.

The company sourced 600,000 different products from 150 different suppliers, selling items ranging from entertainment goods, books, gadgets, games and even coffee and tea. Rarewaves exported to consumers in over 170 countries in the first 12 months of exporting – using marketplaces like Rakuten, Amazon Worldwide, Fnac, Price Minster and GAME to extend their reach.

After signing a deal with Amazon Australia, Rarewaves securined £60,000 worth of sales to Australian customers in its first four weeks of exporting. With support from the Department for International Trade (DIT), the company expects to see annual turnover double to more than £20m in the next 12 months and to take exporting activities even further.
