Jo Smedley launched the business ten years ago from her spare room. Red Herring Games is now preparing to ship 500 boxsets to Amazon’s warehouse in Illinois.

Jo already had her own website and was taking small orders through Amazon when she approached the Department for International Trade (DIT) four years ago. For the next stage of her exporting journey, Jo needed expert help from a International Trade Adviser (ITA) from DIT. By exporting, Jo and Red Herring Games can now reach new markets they’d never dreamed of. With Amazon US forecasting over £200,000 sales over the next five years.

The further across the world Jo reaches, the more she’s had to consider when it comes to making her business global-friendly. While her ITA is only ever just a phone call away, Jo was also put in touch with a DIT E-Commerce Adviser, who showed her the importance of customising her international websites to suit the cultural differences of her export market.
 
With a turnover of 75% on Amazon alone, Jo has outgrown her small Grimsby shop and is now looking at setting up offices in both Australia and America. On her success to date, Jo never thought she could get to this stage “I always thought we were too small, but now we’re not.”
