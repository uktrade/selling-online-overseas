Designed in partnership with Anglo-Swiss watch industry experts, Burlingham London create watches inspired by British heritage, British exploration and British philanthropy. With support from Department of International Trade (DIT), Burlingham London now export their watches through global marketplaces such as Amazon and Newegg.

Burlingham London first started selling online to the UK before their DIT trade advisor introduced them to US marketplace Newegg - who offer reduced commission rates for UK sellers. Newegg and DIT raised the profile of UK products with US customers by taking part in ‘GREAT British’ online promotions led by DIT.
