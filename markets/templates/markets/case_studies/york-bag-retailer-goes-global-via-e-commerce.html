{% block story_content %}<p>In 2013, Maxwell Scott Bags noticed an increase in orders from Germany. They decided to launch both a German and US website and successfully increased their exporting business.</p>

<p>Exporting overseas has seen the business grow by 300% in 3 years and led to the appointment of a Head of e-Marketplaces who focuses on expanding their business further in the online world.</p>

<p>The business asked the Department for International Trade (DIT) for marketplace advice to help increase their business. From listening to the e-commerce advisor at DIT, 25% of Maxwell Scott Bags export sales are now through Amazon.</p>{% endblock %}


{% block story_blockquote_bottom_content %}Working with Amazon has allowed us to save money on buying our own warehouses and additional manpower, and focus on growing other areas of the business.{% endblock %}
